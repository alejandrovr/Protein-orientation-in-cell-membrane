    "In order to implement the presented algorithm, we have made the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (*) Protein orientation in the membrane follows a given pattern when we look at the mean plane generated by the different planes of their aromatic rings, since they are highly hydrophobic.\n",
    "    (*) Global hydrophobicity is a good measure of whether or not a protein is properly placed in the membrane.\n",
    "    (*) Membrane width is usually constant across the membrane and has a width of 3 nm [1].\n",
    "    (*) Normalized hydrophobicies can be used to infer global hydrophobicy [2]. Of course, this can be corrected by proximity or accessibility to the solvent, in this case water, so both ASA and solvation have been implemented as optional considerations."

    "    (*) if asa = True, it runs an adaptation of a code from Boscoh to compute Accessible Surface Area for each residue in order to compute hydrophobicity more accurately (improvement with tested proteins has not been significant, though). Code to run this function is present in the .py files of the folder . Source code can be found in: (https://github.com/boscoh/pdbremix/blob/master/pdbremix/asa.py)\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "At the light of our results, we can say the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aromatic rings are not a self-sufficient or good enough criteria to determine membrane positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neither of the methods we came up with in order to improve membrane placement produced highly better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the case of iterative search, we considered global hydrophobicity as a good indicator of how good an alignment between the protein and the membrane was. However, what we did not consider was that maybe some of the optimal conformations were not actually possible due to spatial constraints. We can see that some of our results actually place the entirety of the protein inside the membrane, which may not be possible for large proteins. At present, it is unknown whether filtering these solutions out of the solution space would improve the algorithm. However, the number of observations is low and not representative of the entirety of protein variation that can be found, so it is just a baseless conjecture.\n",
    "    - In the case of ASA, we thought it might help when dealing with hydrophobic cores surrounded by hydrophilic residues, but the improvement is not clearly visible and we lack statistical power to test if it is significant.\n",
    "    - In the case of solvation, we can say the same as ASA.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be that the method we used to compute hydrophobicity was not a good approach and the improvement methods that we applied could not correct the fact that we started with a wrong assumption. Another explanation could be that the normalized hydrophobicity coefficients that we used where not adequate for this kind of computation. These have been taken from the bibliography, yet instead of taking them, one could simply obtain them through computing the RMSD between a large enough set of proteins taken from OPM and the ones that we have rotated (with the aromatic ring criteria or any other to position them) and then optimizing by this RMSD and deriving the set of coefficients that would make this result possible. Of course, these would need to be averaged either by the whole set of proteins or by subsets, whichever works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of this last solution giving artefactual results also needs to be taken into consideration, but considering that similar proteins also have similar biochemical propiertries is not too far of a stretch from other approximations already done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something interesting to see is whether or not our algorithm is at least capable of properly predicting protein topicity, but seeing the results yielded so far, this is unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we can say that the approach we have tried in order to compute the rotation angle that needs to be applied to the protein has not proved successful. Regarding the Z positioning of the membrane, we achieve passable results for some kinds of integral proteins, while the positioning for peripheral proteins is systematically bad."
